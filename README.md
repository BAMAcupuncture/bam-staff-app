# BAM Acupuncture Task Management System v2.0

A secure, modern, and robust task management application built specifically for BAM Acupuncture clinic. This is a complete rebuild of the original system with enhanced security, improved architecture, and better user experience.

## üöÄ Key Improvements in v2.0

### Security Enhancements
- **Environment Variables**: Firebase configuration now uses secure environment variables instead of hard-coded keys
- **Unified Architecture**: Single React SPA eliminates security vulnerabilities from the previous dual-app structure
- **Secure Authentication**: Streamlined Firebase authentication with proper error handling

### Technical Improvements
- **Modern React Router**: Client-side routing for seamless navigation
- **Enhanced Notifications**: Clean in-app notification system replaces browser alerts
- **Improved Data Model**: Consistent Firestore data structure for reliable profile loading
- **Better Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling throughout the application

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first design that works on all devices
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clean, modern interface with clear navigation
- **Real-time Updates**: Live data synchronization across all users
- **Professional UI**: Production-ready design with attention to detail

## üîß Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Configuration (CRITICAL)

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your Firebase credentials:

```env
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY="your-api-key"
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="your-auth-domain"
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="your-project-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="your-storage-bucket"
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID="your-sender-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID="your-app-id"
VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID="your-measurement-id"
```

**Important**: 
- The `VITE_` prefix is required by Vite
- Never commit the `.env` file to version control
- Add the same variables to your Netlify deployment settings

### 2. Firestore Data Model

For reliable operation, ensure your Firestore `team` collection follows this structure:

- **Document ID**: Must be the user's Firebase Authentication UID
- **Required Fields**:
  ```json
  {
    "name": "User Full Name",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "Admin" | "Staff",
    "uid": "firebase-auth-uid",
    "status": "active",
    "phone": "optional-phone-number"
  }
  ```

### 3. Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:5173
```

### 4. Deployment

The application is configured for Netlify deployment:

1. Push code to your GitHub repository
2. Connect repository to Netlify
3. Configure environment variables in Netlify settings
4. Deploy automatically with the included `netlify.toml` configuration
